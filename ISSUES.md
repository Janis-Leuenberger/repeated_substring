## REPEATED SUBSTRING

# Issues

The Task is described a little diffrent each time:
-Flyer:		"Leerzeichen geh√∂ren nicht zur Zeichenkette." 
-README.md:	"NOTE: The substrings can't be all spaces."

-repeated_substring_spec.rb:	"find the most repeated substring for every line of a file"
-README.md:						"You are to find the longest repeated substring in a given text."

Also the flyer wants me to find the longest repeating substring in a file, but the test is clearly setup to find the longest for each line.
